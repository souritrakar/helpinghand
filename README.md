Helping Hand

This is a React Native App I have been working on, which connects Orphanages or NGOs to normal peopl, in the aim of reducing poverty, even if it is a very small amount.

Tools used: Firebase (Back-end as a service), React Native, Expo CLI, and React Native NPM Modules. Also uses Linking API for showing request location in Google Maps.
